# SEIS-630-Final-Project
Database Design for the FIFA World Cup
The FIFA Menâ€™s World Cup, so called the World Cup, is the largest and most prestigious international football tournament, attracting millions of viewers from around the world. With the increasing popularity of football, the need for an efficient and comprehensive database to store and manage the vast amount of data associated with the tournament has become essential.

The aim of this final project is to design a basic database for the World Cup that will store and manage data related to the teams, players, matches, and tournament statistics. The database will provide a platform for users to access information about the tournament, including schedules, results, team standings, and player statistics.

The database design project will apply theoretical knowledge from the SEIS 630-03 Database Management Systems and Design course into practical by carrying out steps of database design such as using normalization, denormalization, building a relational model, ER diagram, transforming data model to database design, then implementing the database and analyzing it using SQL.

The project will cover these following topics:

Analysis of the data requirements: Chapter 2 begins with an analysis of the data requirements for the FIFA World Cup database. Chapter 3 will involve an examination of the data sources, data elements, and data relationships that are required to support the database.
Normalization/Denormalization: In Chapter 4, a process of normalization and denormalization will be carried out to organize the data efficiently.
Relational Model: Chapter 4 also includes the topic of relational model and ER diagram which are developed based on the normalized data.
Database Design: Chapter 5 will describe transformation of the data model into a database design, including the creation of the database schema, description of database relationships, table dictionary and DDL creating tables.
Database implementation: Chapter 6 will also involve the implementation of the database and the evaluation of its performance and functionality. It will describe the SQL DDL and DML statements for inserting, updating, and deleting tables.
SQL Views and SQL/PSM: In the second part of Chapter 6, SQL Views and SQL/PSM will be used for the analysis of the database performance metrics.

Tools used for this project: Oracle SQL Developer, Oracle Data Modeler, Jupyter Notebook
